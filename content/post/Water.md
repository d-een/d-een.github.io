This work is my perspective and thoughts about this specific topic, greatly inspired by the works of Miyamoto Musashi and Takehiko Inoue.

Bruce Lee said in a certain interview, "Be like water...". This got me thinking, what does it mean to __Be like water__. For that I needed to understand not just the chemical composition of water but also it's nature. 

Being one of the four major elements, water is a great part of our lives as living beings. Some do say that one of the main reasons we have life on earth is due to the presence of water.  Unlike fire that is both a master and a slave water is completely free, not dependent on other factors but greatly influenced by external factors. Water does not serve or command a sense of danger/threat yet it is both essential for life and can take life away as easily as it gives. Water does not take any shape or form but still no matter where or how you keep it, water is still water. You cannot change water, you can only change the form it has for the duration you wield it. 

Flowing water, for example a river, will forge its own path towards it's destination. Water will flow slowly on flat grounds, fast on steep grounds, some areas the water level will be high in others only a tiny stream making you question if it really counts to be a river but the underlying constant is that it will always keep flowing, steadily! Stoics and Taoist relay most of there teachings to flowing water because of this. A common Tao saying goes something like, _A stoic is like a flowing river, when met with a boulder (everyday obstacles) it will not try to climb or force it's way over the boulder instead it will maneuver around the boulder and keep moving on_.

I look forward to a time when I will come back to this article with a more expanded view or deeper understanding to what it means. My conclusive understanding for now is that WATER IS COMPLETELY FREE!
