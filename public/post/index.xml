      <description>SheHacksctf2023 SnifferHoundwriteup Hello folks!
Shehacksctf was wild, it was great to see hackers from all over the country compete at such a level. I played with the Seekers team and &amp;ndash;spoiler alert&amp;ndash; we got first place. On day 2 of the competition the hosts added a few more challenges that made the race to first place even more intriguing. Apparently pwn challs were a no-go-zone for everyone, all players left defeated by those challenges.</description>
